# What is data transformation? 👨‍💻

Many times in real life, you will be working with imperfect datasets with quality issues. **Data transformation** is the process of modifying a dataset in appropriate ways in order to eliminate these quality issues. Some of these activities include:

- Splitting columns
- Converting dates to `datetime` objects, which are far more easily manipulable using `pandas` libraries
- Encoding categorical variables
- Dealing with and replacing null or missing values
- Creating unique identifiers

The `pandas` library has many functions which can help with this task. In addition, you will also be using some other standard libraries like `String`, `base64`, and `sklearn`.
